**Project Overview: AI Ghibli Art Generator** 🎨


📌 **Project Goal**:
To create a web-based AI tool that transforms user-uploaded images into Studio Ghibli-style artwork using a Stable Diffusion Image-to-Image (img2img) model.


🔧 **Key Features:**
✅ AI-Powered Image Stylization: Converts images into an artistic Ghibli-style look.
✅ Stable Diffusion Model: Uses runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 to generate AI-enhanced images.
✅ User-Friendly Web App: Built with Gradio, allowing users to upload images easily.
✅ Customizable Prompts: Users can modify the style prompt to generate different effects.
✅ GPU Support for Faster Processing: Uses CUDA (if available) for better performance.
✅ Cloud-Based Model Loading: Downloads AI models from Hugging Face Hub.


📜 **How It Works:**
1️⃣ User uploads an image through the web app.
2️⃣ The AI model reads the image and applies the style based on the prompt.
3️⃣ The output image is displayed, stylized in a vibrant, anime-inspired look.
4️⃣ Users can download or share the AI-generated artwork.


🛠️ **Technologies Used:**
Technology	Purpose
Python	Core programming language
Gradio	Builds the interactive web app
Stable Diffusion	AI model for image transformation
Torch (PyTorch)	Runs deep learning models
PIL (Python Imaging Library)	Handles image processing
Hugging Face Hub	Stores and retrieves AI models


🚀 **Potential Enhancements:**
🔹 More Art Styles: Add support for Van Gogh, Picasso, or Cyberpunk styles.
🔹 Advanced Controls: Allow users to adjust strength, contrast, and colors.
🔹 Batch Processing: Enable multiple images to be processed at once.
🔹 Mobile-Friendly UI: Optimize the app for mobile users.
🔹 Live AI Sketching: Real-time AI-generated sketches from webcam input.


🌟 **Final Outcome:**
A fun, interactive AI tool that allows users to turn any photo into stunning anime art, making AI-driven creativity accessible to everyone! 🎭✨
